ArduinoPort Example

VirtualPanel uses an uderlying library called ArduinoPort.
This library takes care of the message protocol.
It can also be used as a means to communicate between Arduino's
In this examples you need two Arduino's (e.g. Uno's),
load one with Panel1Remote, the other with Remote and connect the pins as follows:

Panel1Remote  ------ Remote
    D10 (RX)  ------ D11 (TX)
    D11 (TX)  ------ D10 (RX)

If you start the VirtualPanel exe this lets you control the remote Arduino via the panel.

The Panel2Remote does the same thing but with two Remotes:

Panel2Remote  ------ Remote (1)
    D08 (RX)  ------ D11 (TX)
    D09 (TX)  ------ D10 (RX)
                     Remote (2)
    D10 (RX)  ------ D11 (TX)
    D11 (TX)  ------ D10 (RX)

Via the panel you can now control both remote Arduino's
